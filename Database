Stored Procedures
- Something I see that a lot of job descriptions mention
- stored procedures are good because of their reusability.
- They are also easily modified by using the ALTER keyword.
- Security has the potential to be enhanced because it creates a facade, allowing users to execute the procedure without directly accessing the table.
- Since only the procedure name is passed to the server (not the whole query), this reduces the network traffic
