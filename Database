Stored Procedures
- Something I see that a lot of job descriptions mention
- stored procedures are good because of their reusability.
- They are also easily modified by using the ALTER keyword.
- Security has the potential to be enhanced because it creates a facade, allowing users to execute the procedure without directly accessing the table.
- Since only the procedure name is passed to the server (not the whole query), this reduces the network traffic
- In SQL Server, a stored procedure looks like: 
  "CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateUserPrivilege @username nvarchar(30) AS [insert your query here] GO;" 
  where @user_id is a single parameter that you want the procedure to take.

- Executing a stored procedure looks like: "EXEC UpdateUserPrivilege @username = 'TestUser' "
